NumberGuessing:
Once the game opens, think of a number between 1 and 100. It will then prompt you to press Enter. It will begin
guessing your number. If it needs to guess lower, press "L", or if it needs to guess higher press "H". Should it
guess your number, press "Y" and the game shall end.

Tic-Tac-Toe:
Once the game opens, put in your name and press Enter. Then have an opponent put in their name and press Enter.
The game will begin, and you will see a coordinate plane like so:

1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9

One at a time, put in a number for the plane and it will mark your location as an "X" or "O". The first player to
get three of their markers in a row, column or diagonal will win the game. If neither player wins and the board
gets completely filled, the game will be declared a Cat's game, and it will end in a tie.
